        <h2>My Beloved Adii,</h2>
        <p>
            On this special day, I want to take a moment to reflect on the incredible journey we’ve shared. 
            From the ups and downs, the laughter and the tears, the misunderstandings, and the challenges that have come our way, 
            we have persevered, holding on to each other and to the love that binds us.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that our relationship is not just by chance but a beautiful plan crafted by God. 
            He has been with us every step of the way, guiding us through the storms and leading us to brighter days. 
            It’s His love that has strengthened our bond and allowed us to grow closer, even when we’re miles apart.
        </p>
        <p>
            This past year has been a testament to the power of faith and love. From the moment I began courting you, 
            I knew that what we had was something special, something worth nurturing and fighting for. 
            Even though much of our love has been shared virtually, I feel blessed every day to have you in my life. 
            Your presence, even from afar, has brought so much joy, peace, and meaning to my days.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know that God has even greater plans for us. I look forward to the day when we can finally be together in person, 
            spending time on holidays and weekends, creating memories that will last a lifetime. 
            I pray that He continues to guide us, to protect our hearts, and to fill our lives with His abundant blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adii, you are a gift from God, and I am grateful for you every day. On your birthday, I pray that He showers you with love, 
            happiness, and all the desires of your heart. May you always feel His presence in your life, guiding you, 
            comforting you, and filling you with His everlasting peace.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for being patient, for understanding, and for loving me. Our journey is just beginning, 
            and I am excited to see where God will lead us next.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wishing you a blessed and joyful birthday, my love. Here’s to many more birthdays together, 
            under God’s watchful eyes, with love that knows no bounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all my love and faith,<br>
            Jeric
